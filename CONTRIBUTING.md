First of all, thank you for your interest in Sharetribe!

Before you spend time working on Sharetribe repositories, please read over our
guidelines:

## Reporting issues :+1:

Issue reports are welcome! Please use the repository's issue template, if
provided.

## Bug fixes :+1:

If you encounter an issue caused by a bug in the code and can fix it in a simple
and backward-compatible way, you can open a PR for the bug fix.

If you are unsure that a bug causes the issue, or if the fix to it is not simple
or may cause breakage for the users of the repository, please open a new Issue
to discuss it first.

## Code refactoring :-1:

By default, we do not accept Pull Requests that do only code refactoring.

If you have a refactoring idea that you think should be implemented, please open
a new Issue to discuss it first.

## New features :-1:

By default, we do not accept Pull Requests that add new features.

If you have an idea for a new feature that you think should be implemented,
please open a new Issue to discuss it first.
